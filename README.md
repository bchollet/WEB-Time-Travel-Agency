# Run server
To run the app, you first need to compile it to JavaScript using the following command **inside the backend directory**:

```bash
npx tsc
```

Run the JavaScript output with node:

```bash
node dist/app.js
```

If it runs successfully, a message will be logged to the terminal:

```
Express is listening at http://localhost:3000
```
